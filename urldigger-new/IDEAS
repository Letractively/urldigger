SOME CRAZY IDEAS TO IMPROVE URLDIGGER
(do you have some ideas to contribute in this project?, please, contact with me)

* Integration with Google Safe Browsing API (http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/)

* List of signatures of potential malicious javascripts in form of regular expressions or similar.
  Currently I am collecting a list of real attacks to extract the information.

  This feature will be a good way for people contributing with new signatures

* Collect al js files and review them separately. Several times the malicious code is inside
  the js files. Example:
  http://neapolitanworld.com/modules/mod_yoo_toppanel/mod_yoo_toppanel.js

* Collect al exe files, calculate el MD5 and compare with some public source of malicious binarys.
  Example URL hosting a trojan bank: http://somesite.com/xmlrpc/data/BANK.exe
